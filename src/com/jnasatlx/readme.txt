This work is a complete Java-Port of the NASA TLX Test implemented in Html and Javascript by Keith Vertanen.
All english texts in this file are taken from the file nasatlx.html by Keith Vertanen.
All german texts in this file are taken from the file nasatlx_german.html, where the German translation was done by Christian Lehsing and Katharina Seifert.

This Java Port was done by Bernhard Glaser in Spring 2014 and is provided without any restrictions or warranties.
It is appreciated if you put a reference to the original authors and me, though.
If you add new features or translations - give them to me and I'll put them into the project.
