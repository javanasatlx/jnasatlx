<h4>What is this?</h4>

<h4>Anything else?</h4>

This Java Port was done by Bernhard Glaser in Spring 2014 and is provided without any restrictions or warranties.<br>
It is appreciated if you put a reference to the original authors and me, though.<br>
If you add new features or translations - give them to me and I'll put them into the project.<br>
This Project has moved from GoogleCode to Github in Spring 2015 due to the immanent google code shutdown.<br>
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/jnasatlx/">The old page on GoogleCode (using SVN)</a> will be online until it is deleted by Google in Fall 2015.
