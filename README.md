<h4>What is this?</h4>

<h4>Anything else?</h4>

This java port was done by Bernhard Glaser in spring 2014 and is provided without any restrictions or warranties.<br>
It is appreciated if you put a reference to the original authors and me, though.<br>
If you add new features or translations - give them to me and I'll put them into the project.<br>
This project has moved from google code to github in spring 2015 due to the immanent google code shutdown.<br>
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/jnasatlx/" target="_blank">The old page on google code (using SVN)</a> will be online until it is deleted by google in fall 2015.
